# Case Study: Wing Solutions Branding and Website Design

## Overview

Wing Solutions is a Brazilian company founded by three friends who value agility, robustness, trust, and mutual prosperity. As a freelancer, I had the pleasure of working with them on this small project and later joined them full time to work on other projects for their clients. The company offers technology solutions to help entrepreneurs and established companies to grow and adapt to changes rapidly.

Wing Solutions needed a brand that could represent their core values and communicate their identity. They wanted a clean, premium, and technological look with geometric figures and strong angles.

## Branding

### Naming
During the brainstorming phase, we explored several names and came up with a few options. We needed a short name that was easy to pronounce and remember and sounded similar in Latin languages. After careful consideration, we settled on "Wing." The name represents the core values of the company, leveraging technology to help businesses take flight, and the founders' background in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, the State of Pantanal, where the Red-and-green Macaw is a symbol of freedom and agility.

### Logo
The logo features a stylized red-and-green Macaw, the bird that represents the company's roots and values. The Macaw's feathers combine the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color scheme, representing the technology that the company leverages to empower businesses. The geometric shapes in the logo represent the company's focus on clean, efficient, and modern design.

### Color Palette
The color palette consists of three primary colors: red, green, and blue, which are the same colors used in screens, representing the technology that the company leverages. The bright red and green are inspired by the Macaw's feathers and represent the company's agility and robustness. The blue color represents trust, stability, and technology.

### Typography
We chose the Raleway font for the brand's typography, a clean and modern sans-serif font that works well on digital platforms.

## Website Design

### Home Page
The home page features a hero section with an animated banner that highlights the company's core values and services. The banner features geometric shapes and the Macaw's feathers to create a clean and modern look. The home page also includes a section that presents the company's services with icons and a brief description.

### About Page
The About page provides a brief overview of the company's history, core values, and mission. We included a section that showcases the team members' profile pictures and a brief description to humanize the company.

### Contact Page
The Contact page features a simple and efficient form that allows users to send messages and inquiries to the company. We also included the company's address, phone number, and email for those who prefer to contact them directly.

## Results

The Wing Solutions branding and website design project resulted in a clean, modern, and efficient brand identity that represents the company's core values and mission. The new brand reflects the company's focus on technology, agility, and robustness, and their commitment to helping businesses grow and adapt to changes. The website's responsive design and simple layout provide an excellent user experience, making it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need.
